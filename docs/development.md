`act` cannot reproduce native macOS or Windows behavior.

## Compatibility suite

The repository's `tests/enduser/` suite is a sanitized consumer-style catalog run on every
certified matrix leg. It covers custom operators, TaskFlow and mapping, hooks and connections,
SQLite provider SQL, sensors, deferral, callbacks and retries, assets, provider-shaped packages,
DagBag/collection, logging, xdist, and REST API CRUD. The provider-shaped corpus verifies user
package composition and execution; registering a real provider distribution entry point remains
out of scope because that is Airflow's packaging surface rather than this plugin's test surface.
